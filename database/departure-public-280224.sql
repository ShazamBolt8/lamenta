Theropods are dinosaurs having hollow bones and three toes and claws on each limb. \"Rex\" means king. Since the meaning of Tyrannosaurus and Rex is clear, let\'s talk about the most well-depicted dinosaur in history, T Rex.\r\n\r\n![T Rex Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTjtuSqq_RYLr4tgslD7Fg23zV3q8nojoEAOQ&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\n# Shape and Size\r\n\r\nT Rex was a bipedal dinosaur, meaning it walked on two legs. It was 12m (40ft) in length, about the same as a school bus, but scarier.\r\n\r\n![T Rex Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Tyrannosaurus_Rex_Holotype.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe head of T Rex is one of the best examples of nature\'s engineering. Its mouth is shaped in such a way that it could perfectly direct the force of all the muscles into one bite. The bite force had 6 tons of pressure, the same as getting stepped on by an elephant. With a magnificent set of 60 eight-inch-long teeth, it could easily pierce a car. However, the way of eating was more magnificent, gripping it, throwing it in the air, and swallowing it as a whole.\r\n\r\n![T Rex Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT5G-D2kjmsa1VMmRLO1jAeXVVLe9hxpmzJAA&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\nLike a bulldozer, their heads had vents for airflow to keep their brains cool during eating. Let\'s just not talk about those tiny arms; scientists believe they are evolutionary leftovers, that is, they may have served a purpose for other dinosaurs but were useless for T Rex, just like the appendix is an evolutionary leftover in humans.\r\n\r\nT Rex is often depicted as a dinosaur with massive thighs and can catch a car at 70 km/h. However, the reality isn\'t that true. Even though they have massive thigh muscles, they couldn\'t run faster than 19 km/h. That is a little faster than your running speed but not like in the movies where a dinosaur can be seen chasing jeeps. No, not at all. It is estimated that if they ran faster than 19 km/h, like every other humongous land animal, they would shatter their bones. This is the reason many large animals seem to be lazy.\r\n\r\n![T Rex Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ5sVztD8DddsqGkBAew-SID6vgMQZjnqWaSQ&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\nThe life expectancy is about 28 years; however, a major advantage is that it can slow down its rate of aging due to factors such as food scarcity, etc. It was a major evolutionary advantage.\r\n\r\n# Extinction\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 20,000 once roamed Earth, with 127,000 generations. Despite having a beautiful body, T Rex was no match for the K-T mass extinction, which not only killed T Rex but many other dinosaurs. The extinction is thought to be caused by an asteroid 6-15 km in diameter, which struck the coast of Mexico. Due to such a large impact, many volcanic activities were caused, and the atmosphere was filled with dust and debris.\r\n\r\n![Extinction Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSalO-EfTiBzlTHQm9KgjuPDx0drdacaTKYzw&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\n# Controversy\r\n\r\nAll the dinosaurs are displayed as skeletons with some skin over them. Since flesh and feathers do not fossilize well, it is hard to imagine how T Rex actually looked like. They may be wrong about drawing T Rex only from the skeleton. Because this is how a featherless owl looks like:\r\n\r\n![Featherless Owl Image](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4584ec0061cb91cb10e83961f63bf536-pjlq)\r\n\r\nNow imagine an artist drawing an owl only from a skeleton... There\'s a very good chance a T Rex looked like this:\r\n\r\n![Possible T Rex Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRZWKGBdTm_QxCkQ7wc-csrWEamBXzUe1-5_w&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\nI hope you learned quite a lot today.

Being black from its bones to feathers, it is one of the most iconic chicks in the world.\r\n\r\n# Cause\r\n\r\n![Goth Chicken Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcStrrnq7MuSqPy6so-M_Js-Hhw_LWYDicvHCQ&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\nHyperpigmentation, which is common in humans, is the cause of the blackness of this chick here. Hyperpigmentation means some areas of the skin are darker than others. It is caused by an increase in the production of a pigment called Melanin. Melanin is responsible for the color (darkness) of hair, eyes, and skin.\r\n\r\n# Origin and Purpose\r\n\r\nIt is found in Indonesia, but a very similar chicken breed called \'Kadaknath\' is found in India.\r\n\r\n![Kadaknath Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ0DENUld_tJ9RME8mnSAyhvEYQPPiLxOUSvw&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\nThey\'re mainly used for fighting and ornamental purposes. While limited evidence suggests it was also used for religious and mystical reasons in the past.\r\n\r\n# More Black\r\n\r\nWhen I say black, I mean black.

For example, Chrome adds a margin of 8px by default. We override these default settings by applying our own settings.\r\n#Breakdown:\r\nLets break down the shared code:\r\nFirst we type:\r\n```css\r\n*{\r\n```\r\nThe `*` here is the universal selector, it means that the code will apply to every element.\r\nThen we do:\r\n```css\r\nmargin: 0;\r\n```\r\nIt will remove default margin (e.g 8px) from all elements and make it 0.\r\nAfter that:\r\n```css\r\npadding : 0;\r\n```\r\nSame as above but removes padding instead of margin.\r\nAnd finally:\r\n```css\r\nbox-sizing: border-box;\r\n```\r\nIt is an interesting property because normally when you add padding to an element, it increases size. For example, 100px width and 5px padding would result in 105px of total size, with this property the padding gets added in size such that it doesn\'t exceed 100px!\r\n#Uses:\r\nCSS-Reset is recommended because it removes browsers\' default style. It is much like cleaning a canvas. You clean your css so you can start from scratch without any impurities. It makes your design consistent. It is recommended that you add it at the top in your css.\r\nI hope that after this there won\'t be any extra space around your div. Hope you learnt quite a lot today.

Seriously? Cola War(s) is an economically strategical war between the two soft drink giants; The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo. In layman\'s terms, Cola Wars are the pathetic attempts of the two companies trying to cancel each other\'s sales and make each other non-existent. Cola Wars started in the late 1970s when the competition between the two companies escalated and became the so-called Cola Wars also known as Cola Wars.\r\n\r\n![Cola Wars Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR00dPRKKP6ZHfQzUVN5Mowm62_YgjCePAkwA&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\n# Pepsi Challenge\r\n\r\nPepsi Challenge is a marketing campaign started by PepsiCo in 1975.\r\n\r\n> The Pepsi Challenge was not just a marketing gimmick, it was true. *David Greising*\r\n\r\nThe original and most famous version of Pepsi Challenge is categorized as a blind-taste test. At public locations like malls, shopping centers, festivals, etc., PepsiCo staff would set up a table with two white cups, one containing Coca Cola and one containing Pepsi.\r\n\r\n![Pepsi Challenge Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSZUYb4SrQMz_0sJI7wd4wa1j56KSaX2-Fb-Q&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\nPassers-by were encouraged to take a sip from both cups and then select which one they prefer. After giving opinions, it would then be revealed which one they had preferred.\r\n\r\n# Results\r\n\r\nSounds cute and wholesome, right? Well, not on the Coke\'s side, at least. Because the consensus resulted in more Americans preferring Pepsi over Coca Cola. This significantly disrupted Coca Cola\'s market share. Pepsi further rubbed salt on the wound by featuring the campaign in their T.V commercials.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ghMYzo0rgrw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n# Reason\r\n\r\nThe reason Pepsi was so appealing is simple. *Homo sapiens* or human beings in general prefer sweeter things over shorter bursts. Pepsi was a lot sweeter than Coke. So people preferred Pepsi. Things changed when Coke asked people to drink whole cups instead of sips. Matter swung to Coke\'s side because it was less sweet, and it is painful to drink something very sweet in bulk - Pepsi in this case. Anyways, it didn\'t change the situation very much. The Pepsi Challenge was one of the most successful marketing campaigns in history.\r\n\r\n# Coke\'s Response\r\n\r\nCoke got depressed over the results and fearing a market free fall (which had already started since World War), they started a new coke called....well..... \'New Coke\'. Things didn\'t turn out so well. More than 40,000 people wrote letters to appeal the old coke to come back. Coca Cola brought old coke back under the name \'Coke Classic\' which turned out to be a \'Classic Blunder\'.\r\n\r\nThere was a reason for that:\r\n\r\n> If you can\'t beat \'em, join \'em.\r\n\r\nThey made Coke Classic because they knew the reason Pepsi was winning was that it was very sweet, so they made changes to their so-called \'secret formula\' to be more like Pepsi. This made their loyal fans very angry and hopeless. It resulted in Coke reverting things to normal just in 3 months after the launch of Classic Mistake.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nWhile the Pepsi Challenge was a brilliant strategy, it didn\'t raise the needle of sales a lot. It was a creative, effective, and viral strategy but done not so efficiently. They didn\'t convince the customer to buy Pepsi. They could\'ve given free coupons, gifts, etc. to enhance influence over the market, but they didn\'t. People just casually switched back to Coke because Coke had already created its foundation very strong and developed a loyal fanbase. By 1996, Pepsi had officially lost the war.\r\n\r\n# End\r\n\r\nI hope you learned about the extremely critical, totally important, unbelievably strategical, and very fruitful Cola War. Things are still hot.\r\n\r\n> The high point of the Cola Wars in some ways was the 1980s, but the Cola Wars have continued and are still being fought today.  *David Greising*\r\n\r\nAnyways, I hope you learned something new and mildly interesting today. Have a beautiful day. Bye.', '2022-11-10 13:34:35', 2, 1),

A solid 12.8 m (42 ft.). Now don\'t get scared about your safety, this monster is long extinct. But still looking at it\'s computer-generated images brings awe.\r\nTitanoboa is an extinct genus of snake, which roamed in what is now Colombia. As previously told, they had an average length of 12.8 m (42 ft.) and perhaps even 14.3 m (47 ft.) long! Adults would reach a body weight of 730-1,135 kg, where the Green Anaconda is 250 kg. \r\nThat\'s us compared to him\r\n\r\n![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRBSI1BhKFgcSgS-nQCXR8hYxbrpgsdgDnVnQ&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\n#Age and Name:\r\nSome people might start dreaming of a majestic fight between a T-rex and a Titanoboa. But very unfortunately you can\'t really take a time-trip to past to see such a fight, because Titanoboa came after the extinction of dinosaurs. Around 60-58 million years ago. The only known species is Titanoboa cerrejonensis. Well, the first name needs not to be explained but the second doesn\'t actually resemble anything about the snake itself. It\'s the place Cerrejon, where the fossils were found. \r\nHis dorsal vertebrae(with an Anaconda)\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.britannica.com/13/132613-004-6DEF22FB/Titanoboa-cerrejonensis-image-anaconda-comparison-vertebrae-world.jpg?s=1500x700&q=85)\r\n\r\n#Diet:\r\nThe snake could have easily become the apex predator, but it wasn\'t. It mainly preyed on fish. Though initially it was thought to have the same diet as a present-day Green Anaconda. In 2013, keen observations revealed it\'s probable pescatarian diet. \r\n\r\n![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRYidaXCVQyimxxBbzhnCPV0S-ym-69c7Z6ag&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\n#Skeletal details:\r\nThey had a unique T-shaped neural spine. But the teeth weren\'t attached sturdily with the jawbone. They could open there mouth almost 180 degrees to engulf large preys and crush them by applying a jaw force of 400psi (The bite of an Anaconda however is around 900psi). Unlike the Megalodon, these creatures have left around 30 individual fossils to observe. Mostly adults, but some juveniles were also among them. They had more than 250 vertebrae.\r\n\r\n![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTi5DcnE-U1VeusRaSW6C3jHQZoToZSO5-MEw&usqp=CAU)\r\n\r\n#Extinction:\r\nAlthough no one knows the exact reason why Titanoboa went extinct, two theories have been put forward.

Listen, I understand your doubt. That, it\'s infinity, the biggest number, how can it be comparable to other...etc. I, also had a similar doubt when I was in 10th standard and I\'d asked my maths teacher about it. Now my exact question was, â€œAny two pair of points has same number of points in between, i.e. infinity. Then why do the distance of the points are different? Well I\'ll come to this question later.\r\n#Real numbers:\r\nSee real numbers are the biggest set of numbers (except Complex numbers). It consists of every number. Both integers and fractions, rational and irrational, negative and positive, zero, all kinds of numbers. The set of real number, consists of all numbers that are required in our day-to-day works, in classrooms, in labs, or in a NASA computer.\r\n#Infinity:\r\nMost people lack one basic concept about infinity. Infinity is not a number. It doesn\'t belong to the set of real numbers. Infinity is a big abstract concept of limitless, which is symbolized by that $\\huge \\infty$.\r\n#Infinite set and Cardinality:\r\nSimply a set having infinite elements is an infinite set. Basically N, the set of natural numbers; Z, the set of integers; R, set of real numbers are all infinite set. But here\'s the difference. They all are infinite but,\r\nZ has all the elements of N, and negative versions of those, including zero. So why isn\'t Z bigger than N?\r\nR has both Z and N as it\'s subset, and all other number. So R might be the biggest, ain\'t it?\r\nBut they are all infinite! How can we compare? Here comes the concept of Cardinality and countable-uncountable infinities. They are pretty much the same. Two sets are said to have the same cardinality if every term of a set(suppose S) can be mapped to at least one term of another. A set is countable when it has the same Cardinality as N, i.e. every element in S can be mapped to N. In other words if a set has a specific nth term then it\'s countable.\r\nHere\'s an example.\r\nSuppose E is the set of even positive numbers starting from 2. Then E = {2,4,6,...}. Here E is a countable set as the nth term can be defined as 2n. But general idea says that E doesn\'t have odd numbers in it. Then N must be bigger than E. But, look carefully, defining the nth term as 2n is basically a function on N. f:Nâ†’Z, where f(n)=2n. Thus we are mapping from N to E, thus N and E have the same Cardinality, and have same size.\r\nThus a function can also be established between N and Z. \r\nf:Nâ†’Z, where f = n/2           if n is even\r\n		 (1-n)/2     if n is odd\r\nYou can try putting numbers 1,2,3,... in that. You\'ll get every element of Z. Thus Z is also a countable set, hence has the same Cardinality as N they have the same size.\r\nHowever the scenario isn\'t same for R. You can\'t map from N to R. Thus R have a greater Cardinality than N and R is hence bigger.\r\nNow you got it? One infinity, bigger than another.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 yeas ago the youtube channel Veritasiium had posted an amazing video about an infinite hotel which ran out of room. In that video the same thing was portraited that as long as the upcoming members has a specific position or rank(countable), they can be given a room in the hotel. When the new arriving infinite guests becomes uncountable infinite then it becomes impossible to fit them in the hotel. It\'s a practical representation of mapping from N. The hotel is N and the new showing infinite members belong to an Uncountable set.\r\n#My stupid question:\r\n- Any two pair of points has same number of points in between, i.e. infinity. Then why do the distance of the points are different?\r\nAfter I\'d asked my sir a question he just told me the concept of Cardinality and nothing else. He later told me figure out myself. So I did. I\'m sharing my thoughts here.\r\nTwo points namely (a,b) and (c,d) lie on a straight line. I\'m not writing the equation of the line from the points, that\'s not necessary in this discussion. Suppose the equation is y=f(x). Now we can define the set of points in between as S={(x,y):y=f(x) and a < x < c}. Thus we can see that for every single line and for different points the set changes. So for more random lines the Cardinality can\'t be equated. This probably makes the lines different in length.\r\n\r\n#Conclusion:\r\nInfinity is truly a screwed concept. We human with our brains, can\'t imagine or define infinity. May be our Cyborg versions can.\r\nWhatever\r\nThanks for reading.\r\nHave a great day.', '2023-06-07 16:23:28', 13, 6),

You might have heard the name before. Even if not, you must have heard an example at some point in your life. This is the example:\r\n\r\n6 has factors 1, 2, 3. And the factors add up to 6. Thus, 6 is such a special number whose factors (excluding 6) add up to 6 itself. Now, that\'s what Perfect numbers are. The number whose factors (not necessarily prime factors and excluding that number) add up to that very number. Now there is another way to put it. Some people don\'t want to exclude that number from the list of factors. They define a Perfect number as those numbers whose all factors add up to twice the number. Now that\'s very simple. If the number N is a perfect number and the factors are say f1, f2, f3, … fn, N. Then N = f1+f2+f3+…+fn. Simply f1+f2+f3+…+fn+N = 2N. That\'s how we get it.\r\n\r\nNow, let me list the first few perfect numbers: \r\n- 6 = 1+2+3\r\n- 28 = 1+2+4+7+14\r\n- 496, 8128, 33550336, etc.\r\n\r\nNow you can tell from the rate they are growing, that they are rare. And the next perfect numbers are extremely big.\r\n\r\nNow, a Supercomputer isn\'t sitting, checking if a number is perfect and, in every decade, it announces a new perfect number. No, it\'s not like that. Kinda similar but not exactly. There is actually a formula to calculate Perfect numbers. Let me just write it down:\r\n\r\n${(2}^n-1)\\times2^{n-1}$ only when ${(2}^n-1)$ is a Mersenne Prime.\r\n\r\nNow what is a Mersenne Prime? Mersenne Numbers are numbers which are in the form of ${(2}^n-1)$, and the primes among them are called Mersenne Primes. Basically, not every ${(2}^n-1)$ is a prime. Here\'s a list of some ${(2}^n-1)$:\r\n\r\nLet\'s just pull out a chart.\r\n![Chart](https://i.ibb.co/sbCtLTW/Untitled.png)\r\n\r\nNow, the primes among them are: 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191. See? They are pretty rare. Now calculating Mersenne primes does require computing power. It\'s like calculating the digits of Pi. Hon\'ble mention. Haruka Iwao used Google\'s cloud computing technology to calculate Pi to 31.4 trillion digits. He actually calculated the first 31415926535897 digits of Pi. Well, math lovers might notice that the number of digits itself is the first 14 digits of Pi. That\'s right, π=3.14159265358979…\r\n\r\nNow back to the topic, Mersenne primes are super rare and require computing power to calculate. The largest known Mersenne Prime is $2^{82589933}-1$. It has 24862048 digits. The number may look good, but it\'s only the 51st Mersenne Prime. Yes, only 51 Mersenne Primes have been discovered so far. When you have a Mersenne Prime, you get a corresponding perfect number, but finding a Mersenne Prime is that hard. Now let\'s talk about Mersenne primes more.\r\n\r\nLooking at the list, you can tell that when n is even the Mersenne number is surely composite. It\'s obvious and always true. I\'ve never seen a proof of this anywhere, so I\'ll show it my way. Of course, I know many other people surely have thought the same way. It\'s simple.\r\n\r\n$Take\\ n\\ as\\ an\\ even\\ number, i.e.,\\ n=2m$\r\nThen the Mersenne number is $2^{2m}-1$\r\nNow, $2^{2m}-1 = 4^m-1 = (4-1)(4^{m-1}+4^{m-2}+\\ldots+4^2+4+1) = 3(4^{m-1}+4^{m-2}+\\ldots+4^2+4+1)$\r\n\r\nNow that\'s surely a composite number.\r\n\r\nNow we know, we\'ve to exclude even powers of two. An educated guess might reveal that composite powers of two might also be excluded. This statement is also like the previous one. I\'ll prove it my way. Like previous, many other people around the world surely have made the same kinds of observations.\r\n\r\n$Take\\ n\\ as\\ a\\ composite\\ number, i.e.,\\ n=ab$\r\nThen the Mersenne number is $2^{ab}-1$\r\nNow, $2^{ab}-1 = (2^a)^b-1 = (2^b)^a-1$\r\nThus $2^{ab}-1$ can be factorized as $(2^a-1)\\times(something)$ and $(2^b-1)\\times(something)$\r\n\r\nThus we\'ve at least two factors $(2^a-1)$ and $(2^b-1)$.\r\nFrom there we\'re concluding that only prime powers of two are allowed. But not all prime powers work either. See the list. 11 is prime but ${(2}^{11}-1)$ is not. ${(2}^{11}-1)= 2047= 23\\times89$\r\n\r\nSo, we\'ve excluded all the composite numbers but can\'t tell which primes will work. Not yet, maybe in the future.\r\n\r\nHere\'s the funny thing about perfect numbers: It can be proved that ${(2}^n-1)\\times2^{n-1}$ is always a perfect number (by always, I mean always when ${(2}^n-1)$ is a Mersenne Prime) but no one can prove that they are the only Perfect number. You understood what I meant? I wanted to say that there might or might not be more perfect numbers which are not in the form of ${(2}^n-1)\\times2^{n-1}$ but no one has yet proved or disproved that. That\'s the fun part.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s look at one of many proofs of the expression ${(2}^n-1)\\times2^{n-1}$. Now I\'m not gonna derive it. I\'ll just show that the factors of the number will add up to that number.\r\n\r\nAssume that $\\sum P$ is the sum of all factors of a Perfect Number P which is obviously in the form of ${(2}^n-1)\\times2^{n-1}$. Then\r\n\r\n$\\sum P=\\bigm1+2+2^2+2^3+\\ldots+2^{n-2}+2^{n-1}\\bigm{+(2}^n-1)+{2(2}^n-1)+{2^2(2}^n-1)+\\ldots+2^{n-1}{(2}^n-1)\\bigm=\\ (1+2+2^2+2^3+\\ldots+2^{n-2}+2^{n-1})+(1+2+2^2+2^3+\\ldots+2^{n-2}+2^{n-1}){(2}^n-1)\\bigm=\\ 2^n(1+2+2^2+2^3+\\ldots+2^{n-2}+2^{n-1})$\r\n\r\nNow from the formula of Geometric progression,\r\n\r\n$\\sum P = 2^n\\times\\frac{(2^n-1)}{2-1} = 2^n\\times(2^n-1) = 2\\times{(2}^n-1)\\times2^{n-1} = 2P$\r\n\r\nThere. We proved it.\r\n\r\nI would like to show another proof here too. A much shorter proof called Euclid-Euler theorem. The theorem states that an even number is perfect if and only if it has the form ${(2}^n-1)\\times2^{n-1}$, where ${(2}^n-1)$ is a prime number. The proof was done by Euler.\r\n\r\nBut before going to the proof, I must say some other things too. There are two famous functions of factors: The Tau function and the Sigma function.\r\n\r\n- Tau function: $\\tau(n)$ = the number of all positive divisors of n, including 1 and n. \r\n\r\nFirst, we factorize n as ${p_1}^{q_1}\\times{p_2}^{q_2}\\times{p_3}^{q_3}...{p_k}^{q_k}.$ Where pi is a prime factor of n, and n has k prime factors.\r\n\r\nThen $\\tau(n) = (1+q_1)(1+q_2)(1+q_3)...(1+q_k)$\r\n\r\n- Sigma function: $\\sigma(n)$ = the sum of all positive divisors of n, including 1 and n.\r\n\r\nThis $\\sigma(n) = \\frac{{p_1}^{q_1+1}-1}{p_1-1}\\times\\frac{{p_2}^{q_2+1}-1}{p_2-1}\\times\\ldots\\times\\frac{{p_k}^{q_k+1}-1}{p_k-1}$\r\n\r\nThis also has a property: $\\sigma(mn) = \\sigma(m)\\sigma(n)$\r\n\r\nDon\'t get overwhelmed. It\'s easy.\r\n\r\nNow $\\sigma({(2}^n-1)\\times2^{n-1}) = \\sigma{(2}^n-1)\\sigma(2^{n-1}) = (2^n-1)(2^n) = 2\\times{(2}^n-1)\\times2^{n-1}$\r\n\r\nThis proof is easier, considering you know the Sigma and Tau function.\r\n\r\nSo, our discussion ends here. Remember this: It can be proved that ${(2}^n-1)\\times2^{n-1}$ is always a perfect number (by always, I mean always when ${(2}^n-1)$ is a Mersenne Prime) but no one can prove that they are the only Perfect number.\r\n\r\nYou might be the one to prove it, or the person to find the 52nd Mersenne prime and 52nd Perfect number.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.

The donkey had ambitions, he wanted to be a Java developer but due to his questionable life choices, he ended up becoming a country pumpkin (still better than being Java enthusiast).\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/LzYv5fX/download-7.webp)\r\n\r\nDespite all this, the donkey served his master well. But due to old age, the donkey was growing more and more and more unfit for his task. The mastered was really pissed off by all this.\r\n \r\nThe donkey being orders of magnitude wiser than his master, sensed his concern, and fled away. He would\'ve sued his master if it was America but life is really unfortunate sometimes... \r\nThis incident put the donkey in epic grief. (Seriously? What did he expect though? A full-covered retirement plan with bonus and medical expenses?)\r\n\r\nThis incident made the donkey rethink his life choices. The donkey said to himself, \"If that Justin Bieber wiv\' \'is voice of a constipated dog can do it, why can\'t I? \'Eck it, I\'m a bloomin\' musician now, innit? Aight it\'s sorted, if that china can bam it yer mate can boom it!\"\r\n\r\nSo the donkey, with sensible ambitions this time, went on his way to Bremen. Hoping to become the greatest town musician of all time. \r\nOn his way the donkey met a dog with face hung as low as Trump\'s self esteem. The donkey asked the pup, \"Mate, wot \'appened to ya? Why the long mug? Come on, cheer up!\".\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/6btcDHR/download-2.webp)\r\n\r\nTo which that son of a bitch replied, \"Ye goddamn donkey, leave me alone, ya crazy bastard! My master\'s gonna bleedin\' kill me \'cause I\'m no longer young and \'untin\'. Blimey, it\'s a right mess I\'ve gotten meself into. Cor blimey, I tell ya, life\'s a proper struggle sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woah there, you whine proper well, doc! Mate\'s well chuffed. Ya fancy becomin\' a musician like me?\", asked the donkey.\r\n\r\nAnd within no time, the dog joined the donkey on his way to Bremen. They ventured on their journey as thrilled as a Dad whose kid finally mastered the art of \"lights out\" when yeeting the room.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/gdrfLLy/download-3.webp)\r\n\r\nOn their way, the two D\'s meet a miserable French cat. (Nothing new, French are always miserable, by the way). \r\n\r\nUpon inquiring, the furball replies, \"Je suis old and lost me claws et me tooth, I can no longer catch mice. Mon owner plans to drown me in freezing water, but moi, je want ze warmth of ze fire-\"\r\nThe dog interrupts, \"Sheesh, mum, that\'s proper bad. Maybe ya can come join us, we\'re on our way to becomin\' the finest in the finest of fine arts, music.\"\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/7YXCkpm/download-8.webp)\r\n\r\n\"Ah, \'ow you say, I guess so, sounds good, but I just \'ope I don\'t end up like mon Aunt Cougar...\", cat replies casually. \r\n\r\nSo with kitty in the gang, the group continues their journey to Bremen. \r\n\r\nWith hours, days and weeks passing by, the three continued their journey. \r\nPublic transport hit them like a ton of bricks, and they couldn\'t believe what they had been missing all their lives! \"Screw you Murica\' for normalizing private transport!\" The three yelled simultaneously. \r\n\r\nHowever they found a rooster sitting on a fence. The rooster was as sad as a single mom on Father\'s Day. \r\nThe donkey cheerfully greeted, \"Ello there!\".\r\nThe rooster while being sad managed to reply, \"Howdy!\" (Oh God, why\'s there always a Texan in tales like these?) \r\n\"Blimey, why that sad face?\" asked the donkey. \r\n\r\n\"Mind yer own beeswax, \'fore I reckon I\'ll have to put my sturdy, tough ol\' cork right into that fancy champagne hole o\' yours.\", replies the rooster.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/37Z2dRq/download-9.webp)\r\n\r\nThe donkey responds, \"Alright, mate, no need to get yer knickers in a twist. Let\'s keep it family-friendly, shall we?\"\r\n\"Sheesh, man, Ah just lost mah cool. Ah\'m old now and mah master plans to kill and serve me for the comin\' guests.\", the rooster says hopelessly.\r\n\r\nThe donkey being the propagandist he was, managed to include the rooster in the gang. (Seriously though, they should hire this donkey for military recruitment campaigns)\r\nWith a cock among the three, the gang continued on their way to Bremen. Before long, they came across an abandoned farmhouse in the distance. The air was filled with the delicious scent of appetizing food drifting from the old farm.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/s1zsM0T/download-6.webp)\r\n\r\nWhat else could please a dog other than a few bones? The cat\'s mouth started watering. The poor donkey and the cockerel were willing to break the principles of their forefathers... \r\n\r\nThey decided to approach the farmhouse. The platoon, led by the donkey, marched toward the building. The donkey ordered the cat to search the room. \r\n\r\n\"Copy zat. We \'ave deux suspects found. Faces covered, a grand table with lots of food. Ze suspects, zey seem all dizzy and careless, you know. Over.\", replied the cat.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/wcSfzxj/download-10.webp)\r\n\r\nThe donkey being the smart-ass he was, (quite literally) thought of a way to secure\r\n the room. The animals put their heads together and started planning...\r\n\r\nThe rooster cried, \"To Valhalla!\".\r\n\r\nThe suspects, who were actually robbers, suddenly became alert with fear evident on their faces. They remained oblivious to reality as the donkey said \"Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Inbound!\" barged in.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/ngLm3zL/download-11.webp)\r\n\r\nAs if it wasn\'t enough already, the dog yelled, \"K9 is on the site\" and started charging towards the poor suspects. Meanwhile the cat just sat there and occasionally shined her eyes towards the robbers giving the effect of an emergency siren. \r\n\r\nIt was utter chaos. As it was night time, the robbers had no idea what was going on. The poor robbers were German and thought it was D-Day II. The poor robbers ran for their lives, dodging K9, and ducking missiles. \r\nThe robbers ran as fast as a cheetah on caffeine. They reached the other end of Germany. There, they met their Boss and informed the whole pandemonium to him. The Boss made fun of them and went with them to the farmhouse.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/f0rhr6b/download-12.webp)\r\n\r\nThe donkey was pretty happy because everything went just like he had planned in his head. He had already prepared the squad for the return of the robbers. \r\n\r\nJust as the robbers entered the farmhouse, they saw two fire balls staring at them. Unlike the other two, the Boss wasn\'t scared at all! He said, \"Would ya look at that, chum? Two beautiful fireflies in June!\". He put his hand forward to snatch the flies, the cat did some surgical strikes on it (least violent French). The Boss cried and immediately pulled his hand back. Just as he turned around to run, the donkey kicked him and his fellows as far as a 32 washing machines. \r\n\r\nThe dog started howling, and the rooster started crowing. It was pure Hell! (unless you like Kanye West\'s music, then it was just normal).\r\n\r\n\"Why is it happening? It\'s not Christmas?!!\", the Boss cried in agony. \r\n\r\n\"What? \", both robbers askes simultaneously. \r\n\r\n\"You wouldn\'t get it.\", the Boss replied.\r\n\r\nThe donkey prepared himself for the final move. He ran towards the robber, stopped, stared at them as if they\'d insulted his mother, and with full might, yelled, \"Critters Convene!\". And immediately the dog jumped upon the donkey (this isn\'t going the way you think it\'s going) followed by the cat and rooster. The rooster crowed, the cat mewed, the dog barked and the donkey? Well, he brayed! It was absolute mess. The eyes of the cat glowed like coals from Hell, the hound barked as if death was coming, the rooster was from Hell! The donkey was Hell!\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/846BM4p/download-14.webp) \r\n\r\nThe robbers shat their pants. They ran, and ran, and ran, and ran, and ran, and ran, and ran, and ran, and stopped for a bit right there, and ran and ran and ran.....\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/m98XKtS/download-13.webp)\r\n\r\nNever to be seen again. \r\nThe animals felt proud just like the Israelis who forced the Arabs out of their own home! \r\n\r\nThey feasted upon the delicious meat present before them! (Don\'t ask about the donkey and cockerel though) \r\n\r\nTimes went by, the squad worked hard and they managed to become the greatest town musicians of all time! (It was Germany, we set the bar too low). However recently, due to disputes they broke apart and became independent musicians. \r\n\r\nThe cat is known as Cardi B. The dog wants to stay anonymous. The cock is Ed Sheeran and, the donkey is Eminem...\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/qJZJd2g/download-16.webp)\r\n\r\nWhat about the robbers? Well one of them worked hard and now works as a PHP developer at Amazon. The other became a trans right activist. \r\n\r\nAnd the Boss recently passed the audition of Home Alone 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Conclusion:\r\nIf you\'re old and your master threatens to kill and you also happen to be German, decide to become a town musician and harass some poor robbers who minding their own business. Success guaranteed 100%.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Background:\r\nThis story is a modified version of \"[Town Musicians of Bremen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_Musicians_of_Bremen)\", a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in Grimms\' Fairy Tales in 1819. \r\nThe images are [AI generated](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini).

In the end there will be a bonus topic, so make sure to read till the end!\r\n# Introduction:\r\nThe term `virus` is derived from Latin word meaning \"toxin\" or \"poison\". Something that is capable of producing copies of itself and corrupting the host, causing unwanted behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe term computer virus indicates any software that is capable of producing copies of itself and disrupts the normal functioning of a computer.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\nAny software that can not run as intended and can affect other softwares running on the computer is a virus. Let\'s say you downloaded \"^^Clean Master 2023\". It advertised itself as being able to remove junk from your computer and improve its performance. But as soon as you launch it, it corrupts all your files and then demands $500 to return them back to normal. You can not delete this software, you can not control your computer. If this ever happens, then unfortunately my friend, you just got a humble little virus.\r\n\r\n# Origin:\r\nThere are many sources declaring the invention of the first computer virus. I decided to settle on [Kaspersky\'s source](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/a-brief-history-of-computer-viruses-and-what-the-future-holds).\r\nBasit and Amjad Farooq Alvi, the two brothers who ran a computer store in Pakistan, made the first computer virus called Brain in 1986.\r\n\r\n![Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lnedOWfPKT0/maxresdefault.jpg)\r\n*Sigh, it\'s always the Pakistanis.*\r\n\r\nThey were tired of people copying their software so they decided to make a stealth virus which infected the boot sector of floppy disks. The interesting part is it merely contained a hidden copyright message and did not corrupt any data.\r\n\r\nThere are other noteworthy examples of viruses such as Creeper, ILOVEYOU (no homo), Rabbit, and ANIMAL but I will leave them as an exercise for the reader. You can learn more about them  [here](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/a-brief-history-of-computer-viruses-and-what-the-future-holds).\r\n\r\n# Types of Viruses:\r\nThere are numerous types of viruses, but for keeping things considerate, we will only discuss 4 of them:\r\n## 1. Trojan Horse:\r\nThis virus disguises itself as a legitimate program. As soon as it gains access to the system, it starts exploiting it. The example of Clean Master discussed above can be considered a Trojan Horse virus.\r\n\r\nI recommend watching this scene from Troy movie for a better understanding of Trojan Horse.\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Td1uPq9K--E?si=x5lbAJqpDfxQnHKy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n## 2. Botnet:\r\nBotnet is a collection of various computers controlled by a central server. The computers are infected by some program installed carelessly by the user. The infected computers are called zombies or zombie nodes. They are then used as an army to perform distributed denial of service (DDoS) or for mining crypto.\r\n## 3. Ransomware:\r\nThis virus is typically transmitted to a computer by a Trojan Horse. It encrypts your files and programs. Encrypted means protected. You can\'t return them back to normal without a decryption key. The decryption key is typically held by the hacker who made the virus. In order to decrypt your files, the virus asks for ransom.\r\nIn simple terms, it holds your files hostage and asks for money.\r\n## 4. Adware:\r\nIt is a very common virus. It is generally not harmful but it can be annoying and invasive to the point that you will seek a mental asylum. In most cases it is easy to remove. It displays random ads randomly on your computer, making it look like Las Vegas.\r\n\r\n![Commercial area filled with ads and neon lights](https://images.pexels.com/photos/802024/pexels-photo-802024.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940)\r\n\r\n# Symptoms:\r\nHaving discussed different types of viruses, we can discuss symptoms of an infected computer now. The symptoms of an infected computer include but are not limited to:\r\n- Sluggish performance\r\n- Random ads and pop ups\r\n- New icons and shortcuts on home screen\r\n- Random crashes\r\n- Abnormal network or CPU usage\r\n\r\nWhile we are discussing the symptoms, I\'d like to bust a very stupid myth. There is a myth that a computer virus can be transmitted to a human or any other animal. It is baloney. If you have ever used an electronic device for more than 5 minutes, you\'d realize how that is not even vaguely possible.\r\n\r\nA computer virus can not infect anything other than a computer. Heck, most computer viruses can\'t even work on other types of computers, let alone humans.\r\n\r\n# Prevention and Treatment:\r\n1. **Install an antivirus software:** Antivirus softwares provide strong protection against viruses. Some good softwares include:\r\n	- [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/comprehensive-security)\r\n	- [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/)\r\n	- [Kaspersky](https://kaspersky.com)\r\n	- [McAfee](https://www.mcafee.com/)\r\n	- [Avast](https://www.avast.com/)\r\n	- [Norton](https://norton.com/)\r\n\r\n2. **Email attachments:** Email attachments are a very common way of infecting a computer. Handle all attachments with cautiousness. Scan them for malware. \r\n\r\n3. **Backups:** A wise guy once said, \"If you haven\'t performed a backup, you do not own your files, you are borrowing them from fate.\" Perform as frequents backups as possible, so in case of an attack you can just restore your files. [Microsoft One Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneDrive) and [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) are solid options that come pre-installed in most systems and are free-to-use to some extent.\r\n\r\n4. **Quarantine:** Disconnect the infected computer  from internet to avoid spreading of virus to other devices and also transmitting your data back to the culprit.\r\n\r\n5. **Regular Updates:** Security updates are important as they patch existing security issues. Never postpone software and security updates. Install them as quickly as possible for maximum security.\r\n\r\n6. **Download Safety**: Perhaps it\'s time to stop being a pirate and download stuff from official, safe, and trusted sources. Be careful of what you download and execute on your system. Scan all the downloaded files with antivirus/antimalware software.\r\n\r\n7. **Format and Reinstall:** Incase the virus is too stubborn, you might need to format your hard drive and reinstall the operating system (Windows, Linux etc). You will thank me for **#3** in this situation.\r\n\r\n# Bonus: Making a virus\r\nI approach teaching with a very different perspective. In my opinion, one should learn any topic profoundly. Therefore I must make no exceptions, and teach you the creation of a virus in order for you to deeply understand the topic. So let\'s head towards my lab.\r\n\r\nRemember what I taught you earlier? That a virus is anything that:\r\n> disrupts the normal functioning of a computer\r\n\r\nYes, that\'s it. We will write a short script that makes the computer practically useless. In other words, we\'ll write a [fork bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb).\r\n\r\nSo on Windows, open notepad and type:\r\n```batch\r\n%0|%0\r\n```\r\nSave it as `rest_in_peace.bat` and run it at your own risk.\r\n\r\nIf you are on Linux, open terminal and run:\r\n```batch\r\n(){:|:&};:\r\n```\r\nYou will meet the same fate as Windows user.\r\n\r\nSo basically, this is a fork bomb. It works by creating many processes of itself recursively and using so many resources that there is no other option than to restart the computer. After restarting the computer will start work normally.\r\n\r\nThe Windows example can be translated to English as:\r\n```py\r\nrun_me OR run_me\r\n```\r\nSo it will keep running itself, until resources are depleted and you computer becomes unresponsive. This virus is a classic example of Rabbit virus mentioned above.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI\'ve prepared you for counter and defense because people are disgusting. Now you can make or disarm a virus. I hope you learnt the topics clearly.\r\n\r\nHave a good day and stay safe.\r\n\r\n^^Not associated with Clean Master from Cheetah Mobile', '2023-10-31 12:16:35', 10, 1);
